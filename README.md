# ElectronicMeters
While engaged in Software development now, I have a background in electronic engineering.
There are many measuring devices used for various things in the engineering discipline.
I decided to start a project trying to replicate their behaviour.
I am starting with a basic galvanometer. In the physical form a Galvanometer can be modified to represent
many different behaviours such as voltmeter, ammeter, VU, etc. So similarly this user control can be modified
to represent various data such as progress indicator, etc. 
This is work in progress. This push has the basics working but needs more work.
